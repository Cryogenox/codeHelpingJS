This piece of code reads if the name given belongs to a variable, function, object or array and shows it in the console. Kind of an experiment of mine but if it helps someone, it's all the better.

How it works:

1. check(yourName);

2. Check in console.


Do not use () or ; in the name you want to check. Simply the name is enough. So say you have a function called myFunction(); and you wish to check it, write check(myFunction);
